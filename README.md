# User Centric Design – Milestone Project
The Brief of the project was to create a static front end only website. I chose to create my own project and create a website for a fictional football team known as the Valley Titans. The website needed to be 4-5 pages, responsive and make use of bootstrap grids and navigation.

## UX
When designing the website, I created user profiles and personas of who I expected the typical user would be. The personas were split into three categories of fans, players and journalists.
A list of personas and user stories can be found [here][1] but for the purpose of testing the following user stories were created.
1.	As a club Fan I want to be able to visit the website to get the latest news
2.	As a club Fan I want to be able to check upcoming matches online
3.	As a club fan I want to be able to watch highlights of recent matches
4.	As a club fan I want to be able to look at action shots from the games
5.	As a club fan I want to be able to access the website on my phone tablet and be able to read the same information as if I was on a desktop, with the same quality.
6.	As a Rival fan I want to use the website to get information on the club and see when my club is due to play.
7.	As a player I want to access the club’s social media via the website
8.	As a Journalist I want to be able to get the club’s contact details from the website

Balsamq mockups was used to create wire frames of the webpages and these can be found here.
